# Single-Factor-Analysis
This is a procedure to carry out the single factor analysis, containing factor cleaning, factor group, backtesting and performance analysis.

Kind of little gadget for a matrue quant. BUT QUITE BAISCAL AND IMPORTANT for JUNIOR QUANT like me.

This project derives formn a written examination of a public fund on quantitative research. The taks is trying to analyse a public fund named "金元顺安元启" in Chinese. This fund is charactertised as low volatility and high return as quadrupled over 4.5 years.

So the main mission is trying to analyse the factor exposion of this fund over this time span. Consider this, further compose a stock pitching ideology, and construct a simulated portfolio to track the nav of the target fund as neatly as possible.

Based on this task, I think this structure can be further used in the factor analysing subindustry.

Whenever and Wherever you find there are more efficient coding method, please leave a message. Thanks for your advice in advance.
